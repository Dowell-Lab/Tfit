\abstract{Tfit is a tool that attempts to identify and characterize transcripts within nascent transcription datasets by using a mathematical model RNA polymerase II behavior. }

\section{Building Tfit-revisions}
In order to start working with Tfit, it is first necessary to build it. Tfit depends on the following libraries to be built:

\begin{enumerate}
\item MPI (can be provided through OpenMPI)  \textcolor{blue}{RDD: I thought the current library dependency is mpich?}
\item GCC $>=$5.0
\item mpic++ (provided through OpenMPI)
\item (optional) docker
\end{enumerate}

In a shared environment such as Fiji, all that is necessary to build and run the latest version of Tfit is to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item chdir into the src directory
\item run `module load gcc/7.1.0'
\item run `module load openmpi'
\item run `make -j(some appropriate number of jobs)'
\end{enumerate}

On a personal machine, these requirements can be satisfied through appropriate package installations. All that is necessary in that case is to follow the first and last steps specified above.

\section{Invoking Tfit}
Tfit has several modes of operation. Each mode is referred to as a module in all documentation, though they all share a number of input parameters. 
Invoking Tfit without any parameters will result in the following usage statement: 

\input{usagestatement} % This permits us to quickly and programmatically update the usage statement as code changes.

The above is Tfit's \textit{usage statement}. This presents a quick overview of all of Tfit's modules and their parameters. From it, we can determine that there are presently three available modules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item bidir -- This module attempts to fit a distribution to existing data.
\item bidir\_old -- This module is the same as bidir, except it attempts to behave more similarly to early versions of Tfit.
\item model -- This module attempts to model every given bidirectional in a dataset individually instead of applying precomputed parameters.
\end{enumerate}

From the usage statement, we can begin to see how Tfit is to be invoked. It is first necessary to call Tfit, then to specify the name of a module. After this, various arguments for that module are specified.

\subsection{Invoking the Bidir Module}
The bidir module requires, at minimum, the following information to run:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An input bedgraph (this may be two bedgraphs if each covers only one strand).
\item An output directory (this will default to wherever Tfit is invoked from). This is specified with the `-o' parameter.
\end{enumerate}

While it is possible to run Tfit with only the minimum number of parameters (technically just a bedgraph file specification), it may produce unexpected, difficult to find, or incorrect results. As such, it is advised to further specify the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A name for the Tfit job. This is used to name various output files. This is specified with the `-N' parameter.
\item A transcription model. Tfit uses this file to infer parameters about a given dataset. Models are provided for hg19 and mm10 in the annotations directory of the Tfit repository. This is specified with the `-tss' parameter.
\item A chromosome name. By default, Tfit will attempt to fit every chromosome in a given dataset, which tends to be extremely computationally intensive. This parameter matches chromosome specifications in a bedgraph (eg. `chr1' etc.) This is specified with the `-chr' parameter.
\item Whether to run the model module on bidir's inferences. It is possible to have Tfit automatically run the model module after inferring information about a given dataset. This feature tends to be very useful when trying to find regions of transcription as quickly as possible. If this is to be enabled, then Tfit must be invoked with `-mle 1'.
\end{enumerate}

Input bedgraphs are specified with the -i, -j, and -ij parameters. -i specifies a bedgraph with only forward strand data, while -j specifies a bedgraph with only reverse strand data. -ij can be used in place of -i or -j, as it specifies a bedgraph file with both forward and reverse strand data.

Given the above information, it is possible to construct an example Tfit invocation:
\begin{lstlisting}
Tfit bidir -ij /path/to/my.bed -o /path/to/outdir -N myjob 
     -tss hg19.tss -chr chr1 -mle 1
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Invoking the Model Module}
The model module requires, at minimum, the following information to run:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An input bedgraph file.
\item A bedgraph file specifying regions of interest. This is specified with the `-k' parameter.
\end{enumerate}

While it is possible to run Tfit's model module with only the minimum parameters listed above, it may be helpful to specify some of the optional parameters listed below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A name for the Tfit job. This is specified with the `-N' parameter.
\item A file output directory. This is specified with the `-o' parameter.
\item A maximum number of iterations to compute. This is useful when the model module doesn't converge immediately, and it is specified with the `-mi' parameter.
\item A convergence threshold. This is useful when the model module doesn't converge or when a tighter tolerance is necessary. This is specified with the `-ct' parameter.
\end{enumerate}

There exist several other parameters, the behaviors of which have not been explored by the author of this document at present. Unfortunately, the bidir module has been the topic of significantly more development, though further documentation for the model module will be written later. 

It further appears that the `-k' parameter may be able to use the results from an invocation of the bidir module, though further testing is n3ecessary to confirm that this is the case.

Based on the above listings, it is possible to construct an example Tfit invocation:
\begin{lstlisting}
Tfit model -ij /path/to/my.bed -k /path/to/regions.bed 
     -o outdir -N myjob
\end{lstlisting}
